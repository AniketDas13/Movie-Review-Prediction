# Movie Review Prediction
Project on 'Movie Review Prediction' using ML with Python
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The scope of this project is to determine the sentiment of a reviewer based on the review that he/she has given. The 'Movie Review Prediction' model has been designed by using Logistic Regression. The feature extraction is done using TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. This project can be easily implemented in various situations. One can add features as and when required.

Reusability and flexibility can be exhibited in the modules. This project is extendable in ways that its original developers may not expect. The model enhances extensibility like Supervised Learning and Binary Classification.
With the advent of the upgraded version of the programming language, we may be able to reduce the code and simplify the understanding.

The dataset used in the project has been provided for reference:
- IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
- https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment
- Contains 25000 positive and 25000 negative reviews
- Contains at most reviews per movie
- At least 7 stars out of 10 → Positive (label = 1)
- At most 4 stars out of 10 → Negative (label = 0)
- 50/50 train/test split

N.B.: The model may not achieve the best accuracy, though fiddling with the various parameters may enhance it.
